# GoogleCalendarReminder
This is for only some kind of POC to add event in the google calendar .
The UI does not have any kind of validation , will add the validation later on
The google api urls are directly used in controller itself , later on we can move these in configuration files
As of now the database operation are not there , we can add these database operation later on.
